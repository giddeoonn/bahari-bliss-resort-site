🏝️ Bahari Bliss Resort — Resort Website (Sample Project)

This is a fictional resort website I created as part of my web development journey. 
It’s a static, fully responsive one-page site designed to showcase a beachside resort’s offerings, contact details, and branding in a clean, modern, and relaxing layout.

📅 As of July 19, 2025 — this is the **best one-page website I’ve built to date**, highlighting my progress in layout structure, responsiveness, and visual design.

🧠 About the Project

I made this project to apply and sharpen my skills in building professional business-style websites.
With this layout, I focused on creating a relaxing and inviting look while keeping the user experience smooth on all devices. 
This helped me grow in handling single-page structures with better spacing, styling, and responsiveness.
